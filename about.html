          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Benjamin Hagen from Norway. I will be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Data Science in 2024.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            My passion lies in exploring the intersection of technology, data, and problem-solving. Through my academic journey, I've gained a solid understanding of various data science techniques, and I'm adept at using programming languages and tools necessary for analysing large datasets and making data-driven decisions.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            During my studies, I've worked on several projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I enjoy the challenges of working with real-world data and turning complex information into clear insights that can drive strategic decisions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My ultimate goal is to leverage data science to solve challenging problems and create innovative solutions that can make a significant impact. If you are looking for a dedicated, solution-oriented, and collaborative data scientist, feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and experiences. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaboration.
