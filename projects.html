              <h2>Machine Learning-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection with XAI</h2>
              <p>This project uses advanced machine learning techniques to handle credit card fraud detection, leveraging a dataset of 284,807 transactions. Employing Logistic Regression and XGBoost models, the project achieves notable accuracy and interpretability, with the fine-tuned XGBoost model reaching an accuracy of 99.97% and a ROC AUC score of 98.31%. Key to the project is the application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for understanding feature influence, providing a comprehensive approach to identifying fraudulent transactions and offering insights into the mechanics behind the model's decisions.</p>

              <h2>Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Customer Complaints in Banking</h2>
              <p>This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a thorough statistical analysis of a banking dataset with the aim of understanding and predicting customer complaints. The analysis identified key customer demographics more likely to file complaints, explored the non-significance of credit scores in predicting complaints, and assessed the bank's reward system. A logistic regression model was developed, achieving an accuracy of 99.95% in predicting customer complaints.</p>

              <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project: Data Imputation Using Strategy and Factory Patterns</h2>
              <p>This project was part of a school assignment to demonstrate proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This project involved creating a custom Imputer class to handle missing data in datasets, using the Strategy and Factory design patterns in Python. The Imputer class supports mean, median, and mode imputation strategies. The Strategy pattern allowed for flexible selection of imputation methods, while the Factory pattern ensured robust and error-free instantiation of strategy objects. </p>
